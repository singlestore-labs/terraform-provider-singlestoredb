# singlestoredb_private_connection (Resource)

Manage SingleStoreDB workspace private connections with this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "singlestoredb" {
  // The SingleStoreDB Terraform provider uses the SINGLESTOREDB_API_KEY environment variable for authentication.
  // Please set this environment variable with your SingleStore Management API key.
  // You can generate this key from the SingleStore Portal at https://portal.singlestore.com/organizations/org-id/api-keys.
}

data "singlestoredb_regions" "all" {}

resource "singlestoredb_workspace_group" "group" {
  name            = "group"
  firewall_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"] // Ensure restrictive ranges for production environments.
  expires_at      = "2222-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  region_id       = data.singlestoredb_regions.all.regions.0.id // Prefer specifying the explicit region ID in production environments as the list of regions may vary.
}

  name               = "workspace"
  workspace_group_id = singlestoredb_workspace_group.group.id
