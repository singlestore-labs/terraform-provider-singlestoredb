}

resource "singlestoredb_workspace_group" "example" {
  name            = "group"
  firewall_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"] // Ensure restrictive ranges for production environments.
  expires_at      = "2222-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  cloud_provider  = "AWS"
  region_name     = "us-east-1"
  admin_password  = "mockPassword193!"
}

resource "singlestoredb_workspace" "example" {
  name               = "workspace-1"
  workspace_group_id = singlestoredb_workspace_group.example.id
  size               = "S-00"
  suspended          = false
}

resource "singlestoredb_flow" "this" {
  name          = "my-flow-instance"
  workspace_id  = singlestoredb_workspace.example.id
  user_name     = "admin"
