# singlestoredb_workspace_group (Resource)

Manage SingleStoreDB workspace groups with this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "singlestoredb" {
  // The SingleStoreDB Terraform provider uses the SINGLESTOREDB_API_KEY environment variable for authentication. 
  // Please set this environment variable with your SingleStore Management API key.
  // You can generate this key from the SingleStore Portal at https://portal.singlestore.com/organizations/org-id/api-keys.
}

data "singlestoredb_regions" "all" {}

resource "singlestoredb_workspace_group" "this" {
  name            = "group"
  firewall_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"] // Ensure restrictive ranges for production environments.
  expires_at      = "2222-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  region_id       = data.singlestoredb_regions.all.regions.0.id // Prefer specifying the explicit region ID in production environments as the list of regions may vary.
  admin_password  = "fooBAR12$"
  update_window = {
    day  = 6
    hour = 14
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `firewall_ranges` (List of String) List of allowed CIDR ranges. An empty list blocks all inbound requests. For unrestricted traffic, use ["0.0.0.0/0"]. Note that updates to firewall ranges may take a brief moment to become effective.
- `name` (String) Name of the workspace group.
- `region_id` (String) The unique identifier of the region where the workspace group is to be created.

### Optional

- `admin_password` (String, Sensitive) The admin SQL user password for the workspace group. If not provided, the server will automatically generate a secure password. Please note that updates to the admin password might take a brief moment to become effective.
- `expires_at` (String) The expiration timestamp of the workspace group. If not specified, the workspace group never expires. Upon expiration, the workspace group is terminated and all its data is lost. Set the expiration time as an RFC3339 UTC timestamp, e.g., "2221-01-02T15:04:05Z".
- `update_window` (Attributes) Details of the scheduled update window for the workspace group. This is the time period during which any updates to the workspace group will occur. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--update_window))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the workspace was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the workspace group.

<a id="nestedatt--update_window"></a>
### Nested Schema for `update_window`

Optional:

- `day` (Number) The day of the week (0-6), where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday, when the update window is scheduled.
- `hour` (Number) The hour of the day, in 24-hour UTC format (0-23), when the update window starts.
