# singlestoredb_workspaces (Data Source)

This data source provides a list of workspaces that the user has access to.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "singlestoredb" {
  // The SingleStoreDB Terraform provider uses the SINGLESTOREDB_API_KEY environment variable for authentication.
  // Please set this environment variable with your SingleStore Management API key.
  // You can generate this key from the SingleStore Portal at https://portal.singlestore.com/organizations/org-id/api-keys.
}

data "singlestoredb_workspaces" "all" {
  workspace_group_id = "bc8c0deb-50dd-4a58-a5a5-1c62eb5c456d" # Replace with the actual ID of the workspace group.
}

output "all_workspaces" {
  value = data.singlestoredb_workspaces.all
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `workspace_group_id` (String) The unique identifier of the workspace group.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `workspaces` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--workspaces))

<a id="nestedatt--workspaces"></a>
### Nested Schema for `workspaces`

Read-Only:

- `auto_scale` (Attributes) Specifies the autoscale setting (scale factor) for the workspace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--workspaces--auto_scale))
- `auto_suspend` (Attributes) Represents the current auto suspend settings enabled for this workspace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--workspaces--auto_suspend))
- `cache_config` (Number) Specifies the multiplier for the persistent cache associated with the workspace. It can have one of the following values: 1, 2, or 4.
- `created_at` (String) The timestamp indicating when the workspace was initially created.
- `deployment_type` (String) Deployment type of the workspace.
- `endpoint` (String) The endpoint to connect to the workspace.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the workspace.
- `kai_enabled` (Boolean) Whether the Kai API is enabled for the workspace.
- `last_resumed_at` (String) The timestamp indicating the most recent time that the workspace was resumed from suspension. If the workspace has never been suspended, this attribute will not be included in the output.
- `name` (String) The name of the workspace.
- `scale_factor` (Number) The scale factor specified for the workspace. The scale factor can be 1, 2 or 4.
- `size` (String) The size of the workspace, represented in workspace size notation, such as 'S-00' or 'S-1'.
- `state` (String) The current state of the workspace.
- `suspended` (Boolean) A boolean value indicating whether the workspace is currently suspended. If true, the workspace is suspended; if false, the workspace is active.
- `workspace_group_id` (String) The unique identifier of the workspace group that the workspace belongs to. This relationship is established when the workspace is created.

<a id="nestedatt--workspaces--auto_scale"></a>
### Nested Schema for `workspaces.auto_scale`

Read-Only:

- `max_scale_factor` (Number) The maximum scale factor allowed for the workspace. It can have the following values: 1, 2, or 4.
- `sensitivity` (String) Specifies the sensitivity of the autoscale operation to changes in the workload. It can have the following values: `LOW`, `NORMAL`, or `HIGH`.


<a id="nestedatt--workspaces--auto_suspend"></a>
### Nested Schema for `workspaces.auto_suspend`

Read-Only:

- `suspend_after_seconds` (Number) The duration (in seconds) after which the workspace will be suspended if the suspend type is SCHEDULED, or the period of inactivity before automatic suspension if the suspend type is IDLE.
- `suspend_type` (String) The type of auto suspend currently enabled.
