  This data source lists all available roles that are defined for a specific resource object. In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), resources (or 'objects') have predefined roles that determine what level of access can be granted to subjects (users/teams). This data source returns those predefined roles associated with the specified resource object. When configuring RBAC permissions, first use this data source to discover what roles are available for the resource, then assign those roles to subjects using the appropriate teamrole or userrole resources.

data "singlestoredb_roles" "all" {
  resource_type = "Organization"
  resource_id   = "8769efa3-7578-49e1-9c07-bcd763488301"
