  This data source lists roles that can be granted for a specific resource (the 'object' in RBAC terminology). In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), there are three components: subjects (who gets access), roles (what kind of access), and objects (what is being accessed). This data source shows what roles can be assigned to subjects (users/teams) for accessing the specified resource object. Use this when configuring permission assignments to understand what access levels are available.

# singlestoredb_roles (Data Source)

This data source lists roles that can be granted for a specific resource (the 'object' in RBAC terminology). In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), there are three components: subjects (who gets access), roles (what kind of access), and objects (what is being accessed). This data source shows what roles can be assigned to subjects (users/teams) for accessing the specified resource object. Use this when configuring permission assignments to understand what access levels are available.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "singlestoredb" {
  // The SingleStoreDB Terraform provider uses the SINGLESTOREDB_API_KEY environment variable for authentication.
  // Please set this environment variable with your SingleStore Management API key.
  // You can generate this key from the SingleStore Portal at https://portal.singlestore.com/organizations/org-id/api-keys.
}

data "singlestoredb_roles" "all" {
  resource_type = "Organization"
  resource_id   = "8769efa3-7578-49e1-9c07-bcd763488301"
}

output "all_roles" {
